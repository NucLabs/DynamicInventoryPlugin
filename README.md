# Nuclabs Dyninv Collection

This repository contains the `nuclabs.dyninv` Ansible Collection.

## MSSQL Dynamic Inventory Plugin

This collection includes a dynamic inventory plugin that retrieves hosts from a Microsoft SQL Server database using Kerberos authentication.

### Features

- Queries MSSQL database for host inventory
- Combines `name` and `domainname` fields to create FQDNs
- All other query columns become host variables
- Supports Kerberos (default) and SQL Server authentication
- Supports constructed features (groups, keyed_groups, compose)
- Caching support to reduce database load

### Requirements

- Python library: `pymssql`
- For Kerberos authentication: FreeTDS compiled with Kerberos support
- Valid Kerberos ticket (obtain via `kinit`)

### Quick Start

1. Install the collection and dependencies:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install nuclabs.dyninv
pip install pymssql
```

2. Create an inventory file (e.g., `inventory.mssql.yml`):

```yaml
---
plugin: nuclabs.dyninv.mssql
host: sqlserver.domain.com
database: inventory_db
query: |
  SELECT name, domainname, os_type, environment
  FROM servers
  WHERE active = 1
```

3. Obtain a Kerberos ticket:

```bash
kinit your_username@YOUR.DOMAIN.COM
```

4. Test the inventory:

```bash
# List all hosts as JSON
ansible-inventory -i inventory.mssql.yml --list

# Show inventory in YAML format
ansible-inventory -i inventory.mssql.yml --list --yaml

# Display a graph of the inventory
ansible-inventory -i inventory.mssql.yml --graph

# Show variables for a specific host
ansible-inventory -i inventory.mssql.yml --host server01.domain.com

# Verify connectivity to all hosts
ansible -i inventory.mssql.yml all -m ping
```

### Testing with Verbose Output

For troubleshooting, use verbose flags to see more details:

```bash
# Basic verbose output
ansible-inventory -i inventory.mssql.yml --list -v

# More verbose (shows connection details)
ansible-inventory -i inventory.mssql.yml --list -vvv

# Maximum verbosity
ansible-inventory -i inventory.mssql.yml --list -vvvv
```

### Example with Groups

```yaml
---
plugin: nuclabs.dyninv.mssql
host: sqlserver.domain.com
database: cmdb
query: |
  SELECT name, domainname, os_type, environment, datacenter
  FROM servers
  WHERE active = 1

# Create groups based on variable values
keyed_groups:
  - prefix: env
    key: environment
  - prefix: os
    key: os_type

# Create groups based on conditions
groups:
  linux: os_type == 'Linux'
  windows: os_type == 'Windows'
  production: environment == 'prod'

# Create additional variables
compose:
  ansible_host: inventory_hostname
```

Test grouped inventory:

```bash
# Show the group structure
ansible-inventory -i inventory.mssql.yml --graph

# List hosts in a specific group
ansible-inventory -i inventory.mssql.yml --graph --vars env_prod
```

## External requirements

Some modules and plugins require external libraries. Please check the
requirements for each plugin or module you use in the documentation to find out
which requirements are needed.

## Included content

## Using this collection

```bash
    ansible-galaxy collection install nuclabs.dyninv
```

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it via
`ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml` using the format:

```yaml
collections:
  - name: nuclabs.dyninv
```

To upgrade the collection to the latest available version, run the following
command:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install nuclabs.dyninv --upgrade
```

You can also install a specific version of the collection, for example, if you
need to downgrade when something is broken in the latest version (please report
an issue in this repository). Use the following syntax where `X.Y.Z` can be any
[available version](https://galaxy.ansible.com/nuclabs/dyninv):

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install nuclabs.dyninv:==X.Y.Z
```
